### SMART TRASH IoT ###
The Smart Trash IoT system is designed to improve waste management efficiency by integrating IoT technology to monitor and manage waste levels in trash bins. The system can automatically detect when a bin is full and needs to be emptied, sending real-time alerts to waste management personnel or even triggering automated waste collection processes.
